Grams Search Engine: We talk about Underground communities, illegal websites or black markets here. They are ‘Underground’ in nature since they are in hidden sites. They are running off from the search engines under the care of onion network; the main problem is that we don’t know how to reach these dark websites. Its hard to find a legitimate vendor on this ocean of money-sharks.

As they have hidden sites, they offer illegal high-quality drugs or rifles, hacking tools, or any illegal services. Till date, you must type the Complex URL addresses in the Tor Browser. It seems difficult since they are illegal. They change their address very often so keeping track of them is a bit tedious.

Those Days are long gone!! The First Search Engine “Grams” (<http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion>)  for online underground black markets has launched, so it lets anyone easily catch hold of the illegal and contraband items faster and the easier way its is very much similar to the Google, but we call it as “Google of the deep web.”

To search for the things you are looking.You don’t need to do anything, just like you type on the search engines like Google, same goes with this Grams search engine. It also looks like Google and is quite the most comprehensive way to find all illegal things.

Currently, Grams search engine crawls results from eight different black markets. It includes Agora, BlackBank, C9, Evolution, Mr. Nice Guy, Pandora, The Pirate Market, and Silk Road 2. From the recent survey conducted by our team to our shocking surprise, Grams is trying to contact more underground website owners to offer them indexing their sites on his search engine.

The Grams Search engine website is now actually acting like an aggregated catalog for illegal services from different sites including child pornography and deadly weapons.

# Jekyll Blog

>Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.

## Simple

No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install—just your content.

## Static

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile)), [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki), HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment.

## Blog-aware

Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.
